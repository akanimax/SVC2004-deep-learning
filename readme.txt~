Step1:

Take all the data from words_binary and train an autoencoder. The network details are given in network_architecture folder. Input size to the network is 96x192.
Note down the loss value of the network. You can give some of the training samples for testing the loss(Let say, random 10% of full data as test samples, whereas full data is used for training).

Step2:
Take the converged network from previous test. Run thresh_wordnet_english_test.py code, which tests the english signs only from svc2004 dataset. You have to only modify 'get_features()' function, which extracts features from signatures.
Output will be a list, which contains error rate for different threshold values.
